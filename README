Overview:

Maniacal Mousetrap is a program that locks the cursor to a specified window or
monitor. This is primarily to avoid accidentally clicking outside of games that,
for whatever reason, do not lock the cursor on their own.


Requirements:
 * Windows XP or later.
 * The Visual C++ 2010 runtime libraries.

This includes any software which interacts badly with Maniacal Mousetrap.
If locking the mouse prevents a specific game from getting input, and none of
the options help, that's something I'd like to fix.

Also, it may be possible to fix situations where the mouse does not behave
behave correctly when clipped under normal circumstances, such as a game where
dragging the mouse moves the camera but dragging no longer works when the cursor
hits the edge of the screen. I have a specific game (Cranky Cat) with a problem
like this that I'd like to fix, and more test cases would be useful.


Getting started:

To start the program, simply extract (or build) the .exe file and run it.

Most of the options should be self-explanatory.

Select the area in which to lock the cursor in the "Lock mouse to" section.

For "Warp method", you should probably select "ClipCursor". I'm not aware of any
situation where "SetCursorPos" works better, but you're welcome to experiment
with it.

To actually lock the mouse, either activate the specific window or move the
cursor to the specific monitor you want to use, and then turn on scroll lock.
The checkbox labelled "Lock mouse right now" will reflect whether the mouse is
currently locked.

To unlock the mouse, turn off scroll lock.


TODO:
 * Add persistent settings.
 * Add more ways to activate and deactivate the mouse lock, including custom key combinations.
 * Add the ability to lock to specific coordinates instead of a window or monitor.
 * Add more options that work better in specific circumstances.
